This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with custom styles that contain variables or functions.  The `@apply` directive doesn't properly resolve these values at runtime, leading to unexpected styles or no styles at all.

```css
/* styles.css */
:root {
  --my-color: blue;
}

.my-class {
  @apply bg-var(--my-color);
}
```

This will not apply the background color `blue` as expected.
